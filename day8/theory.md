## topics covered
- buy and sell stocks
- sorting complexity
- merge sorting arrays
- moving zeroes at the end
- max consecutive ones
- missing numbers in an array
- find sum of n number using formula: n(n+1)/2

## important notes 
- time complexity of sorting algorithm is always O(nlogn);
- .sort((a,b)=> a-b); // increasing order, .sort((a,b)=> b-a); // decreasing order
- hashtable formation and its use 
- bitwise XOR operation
