## learnings 
- whenever there's 'circular' word in the interview questions of dsa, always make the array/linked list double. 
    exp: [123] -> [1,2,3,1,2,3];
- Always make sure to use Stacks for the questions like next greater element(NGE), previous greater element (PGE), next smallest element (NSE), previous smallest element (PSE).
