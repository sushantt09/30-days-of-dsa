## topics covered 
- recursion 
- n-1 recursion function
- time complexity of fibonacci number using recursion is O(2^n) which is very bad and so we use dynamic programming to make it optimized.

## notes 
- infinite recursion leads to stack overflow
- recursion - 1. base condition 2. recursive condition
