## topics covered 
- string return last word length

## learnings
- trim()- removes the space from the front and back of the string.
- split()- converts the string to an array by passing the breaking point from the string.
- .length - gives the length of the variable, array etc
- whenever searching in an array or string go for hashmap or Set.
- if there's a loop over finite or limited number in a string or array then it is O(1) time complexity.
- strings + hashmap or set, maximum Time complexity - O(52) for map and O(26) for set. and Space complexity : O(1); because numbers are infinite and string are alphabets so maximum 26 which is a finite number.
